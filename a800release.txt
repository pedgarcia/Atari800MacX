Atari800 v5.2.0 Latest
Version 5.2.0 (2023/12/29)
New features:
possibility of renaming the host device "letter" from previously hardcoded
H: to any letter but C: (cassette), E:, K: and S:
So if you have e.g. a program with hardcoded "D:" (as for diskette) you
can now use it on a host device as well by renaming the host device to D:
either via the Emulation configuration -> Host device settings menu
or using command line option

-Hdevicename <X>

little thing but useful (for me at least): tooltip in the settings
menu that reminds users there are virtual host devices with
automatic ATASCII<->ASCII conversion (mainly end-of-line character).

Extremely useful for all text files including ATARI BASIC source code
that can be stored using LIST "H6:PROGRAM.LST" and read back using
ENTER "H6:PROGRAM.LST" (H6 = H1 with ASCII conversion, etc.).

 ATARI800_5_1_0

Atari800 v5.1.0
Version 5.1.0 (2023/12/28) - released at SILK
Thanks to all the contributors (see git log for each commit author)

New features:
New command line options:
-playbacknoexit => don't exit the emulator after playback finishes

-joy-distinct => allows larger number of joysticks by not combining multiple physical
devices into a single emulated joystick. For example this allows using
keyboard to emulate one or two joysticks, and to use these in conjunction
with physical SDL joysticks / controllers in order to play with more people
than there are SDL joysticks. The same logic gets applied to LPT joysticks,
these come after joysticks from keyboard emulation.

Furthermore, the logic also gets applied to put SDL joysticks after LPT
joystics even when the command line flag isn't set. Since LPT joysticks
take precedence over SDL joysticks on the same emulated device, this takes
a device that was completely ignored before and makes it useful now.

The assignments are fixed at program start-up, after config file and command
line flags have been taken into account. If the UI is used to enable or
disable a keyboard-emulated joystick, this can cause an emulated joystick
to be controlled by multiple physical devices, or by none.

Swap also SDL joysticks on AltL+J

This swaps all physical devices connected to the first two emulated
joysticks: the keyboard keys, the SDL devices, and the LPT devices.

After the swap the real joystick / hat setting in the UI will appear swapped
as well, but the keyboard setting won't (fixes #156).

Show all input events on a single line during recording

This way the recording file alternates between two forms of lines: input
lines which contain all keyboard and joystick events in one line, and output
lines with the screen content digest. By filtering out the former, the
latter can be aggregated nicely, e.g. using a command like this:

zcat ${file:?} | grep -vE '^[0-9A-F]{8} *$' | uniq -c

Consecutive frames of equal input state will be represented as a single row,
with a repeat count giving an idea for how long the state was maintained.

RAM cartridges implementation (#184)

Many RAMCART and one SiDiCar cartridges
Support for writeable cartridges
CART monitor command
Make blank cartridge UI option
Reserved CART file ids for additional cartridge types currently unemulated by Atari800,

Atari800 v4.1.0

@joysfera joysfera
 ATARI800_4_1_0
 d9d9ad1
Atari800 v4.1.0
Version 4.1.0 (2019/04/13)
New Features:
Atari800 now includes Altirra BIOS-es for all emulated systems: 400/800,
XL/XE, and 5200; as well as Altirra BASIC. It is now possible to use the
emulator without providing any ROM images.

The Altirra OS-es and Altirra BASIC can now be selected by users in the
"System settings", if they want to use them. Previously Altirra OS was used
automatically only when no other OS ROMs were found.

joyhat support for all four real joysticks, configurable in CLI/cfg/TUI

Notable changes:
All documentation specific to building Atari800 on Windows has been moved
from DOC/INSTALL to a new file, DOC/BUILD.windows. This document
has also been expanded with a new chapter covering building Atari800 using
MSYS2.

Ability to use the built-in EmuOS firmware has been removed. Users wishing
to run Atari800 without providing OS ROMs now have an option of using the
built-in Altirra OS-es, which are compatible with much more Atari software
than EmuOS.
At the same time, it is still possible to compile a version of Atari800
without any OS ROMs built in, by means of the --disable-altirra_bios
configure option.

Port specific improvements:
== Atari Falcon ==

More Videl/screen handling fixes
Ability to run Atari800 in an AES-less environment
Replaced C2P with MMU friendly and faster code
Atari800 should run on all TOS clones with XBIOS Sound API
== Android ==

Fixed building of the Android target, broken in the previous release.
Fixed labels on console keys (unreadable on hi-res displays)
Fixed console keys press detection
Fixed "right-handed joystick" trigger press
== Raspberry Pi ==

updated build documentation
find proper Broadcom GLes libraries
fixed bug in GRAPHICS 9 (shifted colors)
== MS Windows ==

updated build documentation
General Fixes:
updated build documentation
it is possible to build atari800 out of source tree
unconnected host joysticks initialized properly, fixes the MULE game
