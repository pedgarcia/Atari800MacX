Years of development of the Atari800 emulator by different people have
it running almost 100% of Atari software. Take it into consideration
before you complain &#8216;The program x doesn&#8217;t work with the emulator&#8217;.
Most of non-working programs we receive are corrupt. They can&#8217;t be run
on a real Atari computer, thus they don&#8217;t work with the emulator.<br>


<br>


The emulator&#8217;s compatibility rate is growing continuously. You can help
us by reporting any non-working software. Please check this first.
&nbsp;This is the list of all known bugs in the emulation. &nbsp;Some
others may have crept in during the development of the Macintosh
version, but are not known at this time.<br>


<br>
Bugs and Known Problems<br>
-----------------------<br>
<br>
* Cosmic Balance (game) hangs before the intro screen. This is probably<br>
&nbsp; due to inaccurate emulation of POKEY interrupts (see below). The program <br>
&nbsp; uses a hardware SIO loader as part of a presumed protection scheme.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; There is a bug in the code which activates the POKEY timers at an <br>
&nbsp; absurdly high frequency. This causes repeated interrupts which hangs the <br>
&nbsp; program.<br>
&nbsp; Probably there is some interaction with SIO which prevents this on<br>
&nbsp; a real Atari.<br>
&nbsp; A workaround is to invoke the monitor and type "c 10 40" and "cont".<br>
<br>
* new Pokey engine doesn't switch to mono output in STEREO_SOUND config<br>
<br>
* new Pokey engine doesn't support VOL_ONLY_SOUND on the second Pokey<br>
<br>
* a few keyboard-related bugs: e.g. pressing SHIFT+1 and then<br>
&nbsp; releasing SHIFT should still give '!' characters<br>
<br>
* The cycle-exact ANTIC/GTIA/CPU timing is not 100%.<br>
&nbsp; This causes display bugs in following programs:<br>
&nbsp; - Surf's up (game) (the horizon)<br>
&nbsp; - Satan's Hollow (game) (horizon) (confirmed sta WSYNC at WSYNC_C bug)<br>
&nbsp; - Dimension X (game) (alignment problem)<br>
&nbsp; - Te.mod (demo) (small glitched pixel in the final credits on the bottom left)<br>
&nbsp; - Our 5oft Unity Part (demo) (cycle-alignment, probably WSYNC)<br>
&nbsp; - Isolation (demo) (vector animations)<br>
&nbsp; - 80 Random Moving Rectangles (demo) (top left of rectangles, screen data<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is modified while drawing a scanline)<br>
&nbsp; - Sirius games: Scores and Text in Worm War I, Final Orbit, Spider City, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turmoil, Fantastic Voyage.&nbsp; These games store screen data in page 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and modify it each scan line.&nbsp; They reuse the same data for each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scan line with an LMS on every line.&nbsp; This makes the code look <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like 2600 code. Emulating this requires trapping writes to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; page 0 and doing partial ANTIC loads. <br>
&nbsp; - Spider City has another bug in the map which is caused by player graphics<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and HPOS being changed before the player is finished being drawn.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is only possible for wide players. <br>&nbsp; - Extract (Demo)<br>
<br>
* Non-bugs:<br>
&nbsp; - Ergo Bibamus (demo) (one pixel of the flower above the perspective scroll)<br>
&nbsp; - Mail Order Monsters (game)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (some colour changes do not align with text, occurs on a real Atari)<br>
&nbsp; - The Break (demo) (bugs on the left side of photo)<br>
&nbsp; - Star Raiders (disk image) (game) (doesn't work on XL/XE, select OS/B)<br>
&nbsp; - Many other disk images of cartridges that work on XL/XE require OS B<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because a once-popular cart dumping program for the Atari 800 generates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an OS B-specific loader. IIRC it loads the image and jumps into the OS B<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RESET vector location, which is changed on the XL.<br>
&nbsp; - Strip Poker (game) (Atari Basic must be enabled)<br>
&nbsp; - Joust (Atari 5200 game) (the game sets all colors to black on PAL systems,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you need to switch the emulator to NTSC mode)<br>
<br>
* The following programs are improved by using the new cycle-exact code:<br>
&nbsp; - 8 Players Demo (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Bewesoft's Demo (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Bitter Reality (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Demonic Laughter (music collection)<br>
&nbsp; - Extract (graphics collection)<br>
&nbsp; - GED (graphics editor)<br>
&nbsp; - Joyride (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Mail Order Monsters (game)<br>
&nbsp; - Master of the Lamps (game)<br>
&nbsp; - Orneta '95 invitro (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Our 5oft Unity Part (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Studio Dream (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Sweet Illusion (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Te.mod (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - The Break (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Miner 2049'er (game) (rotating 5's)<br>
&nbsp; - Dimension X (game) (title screen upper and lower bars)<br>
&nbsp; - Graphics impossible (demo) (Antic magazine)<br>
&nbsp; - Power Graph (graphics editor)<br>
&nbsp; - Darkness Warrior (picture)<br>
<br>
* POKEY interrupts are scanline-, not cycle-exact.<br>
&nbsp; This causes display or sound bugs in following programs:<br>
&nbsp; - Joyride (demo) (white lines on title picture)<br>
&nbsp; - Mirax Force (game) (speech)<br>
&nbsp; - Saturday Demo (demo) (music)<br>
&nbsp; - The Last Guardian (game) (speech)<br>
<br>
* VOL_ONLY_SOUND causes sound bugs in following programs:<br>
&nbsp; - Digital Trash (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Ghostbusters (game)<br>
&nbsp; - Overmind (demo)<br>
<br>
* intensive 130xe-banks switching slows down emulation much.<br>
&nbsp; This causes performance problems in following programs:<br>
&nbsp; - Impossible but Real (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Sheol (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Total Daze (demo)<br>
&nbsp; - Ultra (demo)<br>
<br>
* SDL port uses call back system for filling sound buffer.<br>
&nbsp; This causes wrong sound effects (noise) in some games.<br>
