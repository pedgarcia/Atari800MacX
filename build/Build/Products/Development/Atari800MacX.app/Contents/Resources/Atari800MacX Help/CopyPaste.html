Starting in Version 4.0,&nbsp;Atari800MacX allows the user to copy text
from the Atari to the Macintosh, and paste text from the Macintosh to
the Atari.  New in Version 5.5 is the ability to copy
and paste ATASCII graphics characters as well as
normal text.  The ATASCII characters are escaped,
converted to plain text between '{' and '}' characters
which are not present in the Atari character set.  In
addition, this allows you to "paste" any Atari keystoke
into the emulator, which is useful for automation
purposes either from the Paste key, or from an
AppleScript script on the Mac.

&nbsp;Copy is only available when the Mac mouse is not being used for Mouse emulation in the
emulator.<br><br>
<big style="text-decoration: underline;"><big>Pasting Text<br></big></big><br>

To paste text from the Macintosh to the Atari, simplu
use the standard Cmd-V shortcut or Paste from the
Menu.  The pasted text is entered into the emulator
as keystrokes. This should allow paste to work
with any program that accepts keystroke input.
The state of the Atari capslock is stored at the start
of the Paste process, and restored after the Paste is
complete. As the keys must be entered
at a normal typing pace, pasting a large buffer may
take some time. Should you wish to interrupt a Paste
in process, simply hit any key and the Paste will be terminated.<br><br>

<big style="text-decoration: underline;"><big>Escaping Characters<br></big></big><br>

There are two type of escaping used when copying and pasting.
The first is used for modifier keys.  The "^" character is used
to represent the Ctrl key, and "+" is used for the shift character.
So to represent a Ctrl A key sequence, Atari800MacX translates it
into this escaped sequence:<br><br>

<tt>{^}a</tt><br><br>

You can combine both of the modifier keys, for example, to enter the
monitor in Action, you use Shift Control M, and the escape sequence for
this would be:<br><br>

<tt>{+^}m</tt><br><br>

Also, instead of {+}, you may use {shift-} or {shift-}, and instead of
{^}, you can use {ctrl-} or {ctrl+}.  So our example above of Shift Control M
could also be:<br><br>

<tt>{shift-ctrl-}m</tt><br><br>

The second type of escape sequence is for special keys.  For these, the name
of the key or an abbreviation of it is used between the brace characters.
For example, a Tab key press would be escaped as:<br><br>

<tt>{tab}</tt><br><br>

You can also combine the modifier keys with these keys.  So a Shift Tab would
would be escaped as:<br><br>

<tt>{+tab}</tt><br><br>

or: <br><br>

<tt>{shift-tab}</tt><br><br>

The different special keys and the text which may be used to escape them
are presented in the following table:<br><br>

You may also insert delays into the paste string by using an escape sequence
of the following form:<br><br>

<tt>{delay-t}</tt><br><br>

Where t is the number of emulator ticks to delay.  In NTSC mode is 1/60 of
a second, and in PAL mode it is 1/50 of a second.  So to delay for one
second in NTSC mode, you would use an escape sequence of:<br><br>

<tt>{delay-60}</tt><br><br>

Copying Text<br></big></big><br>

To copy text from the Atari to the Macintosh, first it
must be selected.
&nbsp;This can happen in two ways. &nbsp;First, you can use the
standard Select All shortcut Cmd-A or select Select All from the menu.
&nbsp;This will select the entire Atari screen, and you will see the
selection rectangle around the edge of the screen. &nbsp;The second
selection method is by clicking and dragging on the main Atari screen,
which will draw the selection rectangle. &nbsp;If you change your mind,
simply click or hit a key, and the selction will be cancelled.<br><br>Once
the text is selected, then you can use the standard Cmd-C shortcut or
Copy from the Menu. &nbsp;All graphics mode 0,1, or 2 text will be
copied to the paste buffer. &nbsp;If the selection area is more than
one line high, a line break will be inserted at the end of each line in
the selection rectangle.Copy also works with the 80 column cards which are
emulated.<br>
Escaping of characters is turned on by default, this may be toggled on/off
by using the "Escape ATASCII on copy" menu item in the Edit menu.  When
escaping is off, graphical ATASCII characters will be replaced by spaces.

Pasting Text Automation<br></big></big><br>

One of the ways to automate the emualtor is by using a feature which allows
you to specify a string to be pasted to the emulatore when the application
starts.  This option is accessed from the <a href="BootMediaTab.html">Boot
Media Tab</a> of Preferences.  On that tab, there is a button named
"Startup Paste...".  When it is pressed, you are presented with the following
dialog box:<br><br>

<img src="StartupString.jpg" title="" alt="" height="262" width="544"><br><br>
    
You may enter the string to be pasted in the text box, and the checkbox is
used to enable/disable the paste operation on emulation startup.<br><br>

Another way to use this feature for automation is to use AppleScript.  The
following is an example AppleScript to paste a string into the
emulator:<br>

<pre><code>
set the clipboard to "String to Paste to Emulator"

tell application "System Events" to tell process "Atari800MacX"
    tell menu bar item "Edit" of menu bar 1
        click menu item "Paste" of menu 1
    end tell
end tell
</code></pre>
