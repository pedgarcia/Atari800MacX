The Gamepads Tab allows the buttons on Joysticks or Gamepads to
be assigned to Atari Controller Buttons or keypresses. &nbsp;It also
allows the user to specify if analog or digital joysticks/hats on
gamepads are used to emulate the Atari joysticks. Note, the emulator
only scans for Gamepads
when starting up, so Gamepads plugged in during operation will not be
recognized.&nbsp;
You must quit the emulator, and rerun it to have them recognized.<br>

<u><b>Button Assignment</b></u><br>

<blockquote>These controls allows the user to assign Atari buttons or
key presses to up to 24 gamepad buttons. &nbsp;Use the Assignment
pulldown to select the gamepad button to assign. &nbsp;Then the user
can assign a different Atari control to that gamepad button for
Computer (400/800) mode, and for 5200 mode. &nbsp;Once assignments are
made, configurations must be saved using the Save or Save As item of
the Configuration Pulldown. &nbsp;Saved configurations are then
assigned to specific gamepads in the Joystick Preference section below.<br>

  <br>

One of the types of Atari controls that may be assigned to gamepad
buttons is joystick directions. &nbsp;This is used for gamepads such as
the iStick, which have a set of four buttons for use as directional
buttons, but these buttons do not identify themselves as a digital hat.
&nbsp;You may assign the joystick directions to buttons in this
section, then select Gamepad
Buttons as the joystick type in the section below.<br>

  <br>

</blockquote>

<u><b>Joystick Preference</b></u><br>

<blockquote>These controls allow you to do things: <br>

  
  <ul>

    <li>Specify which type of joystick is used on each Gamepad to
simulate the Atari joystick/paddle.</li>

    <li>Specify which Analog joystick or Digital Hat to use, if your
gamepad has more than one.<br>

    </li>

    <li>Specify the Button Assignment configuration to assign to each
gamepad.&nbsp;</li>

  
  </ul>

There are 3 types of Gamepad devices that may be used to simulate the
joystick. &nbsp;The first is an analog joystick. The second is a
digital hat. &nbsp;And the third, is a set of gamepad buttons assigned
in a Button Assignment Configuration above. The second of the two
pulldowns for each gamepad in this section
chooses the type of joystick to use for that gamepad. &nbsp;If Analog
joysticks
or Digital Hats are not present on your gamepad, their menu items will
be
disabled, or greyed out. Digital Hats and Gamepad Buttons are not
useful
for simulating paddles, as they only have 3 positions, far left, far
right,
and centered.<br>

  <br>
The second pulldown allows you to select from more than one joystick or
hat on your gamepad, if they are present. &nbsp;For Analog joysticks,
there is also another option, Multi stick, for gamepads which have
multiple joysticks. &nbsp;With this option selected, each joystick
assigned to the gamepad in the <a href="ControllersTab.html">Controllers Tab</a>
will be assigned to a different joystick on the gamepad, up to the
number of joysticks. &nbsp;This is useful for such 5200 games as
Robotron and Space Dungeon, where both 5200 controllers were used by
one player<br>

  <br>

The button assignment pulldown allows you to assign a button
configuration to each Gamepad. &nbsp;The Standard configuration assigns
the joystick trigger to each button. &nbsp;The other custom
configurations may be created in the Button Assignment section above.<br>
