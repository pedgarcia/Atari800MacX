<br>

The Printer Tab controls the type of printer emulation that is used
for outputting to the P: device from the emulated Atari.&nbsp;
Note,
that the P: Patch must be enabled on the Atari System Tab for this tab
to be active.<br>

<br>

The are five choices for printer emulation, Text Printer, Atari 825,
Atari 1020, Epson FX-80, and ATASCII Printer. &nbsp;The Text printer simply sends
the
printer output to a text file with optional script processing, while
the other four choices emulator a
legacy printer or a printer capable of printing Atari special characters, and allow the user to save the printer output in a PDF
file. &nbsp;More info on use of the printer can be found on the <a href="PrinterEmulation.html">Printer Emulation</a>
help page.<br>

<br>

The sections below describe the options available for each of
the printer types.<br>

<br>

<br>

<b><u>Text Printer</u><br>

</b>
<blockquote><img style="width: 722px; height: 491px;" alt="" src="PrinterTextTab.jpg"><br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Print
Command:</span><br>

The only option for this printer type is&nbsp;the command used to
print. &nbsp;Within the command, %s is used to
represent the file name of the temporary file generated during
printing. &nbsp;For example,
if you wanted the printed text to be opened in BBEdit, you would enter
"bbedit
%s" (without quotes) in the box. &nbsp;By default, the OSX command
"open
%s" is used, which will open the printed text in TextEdit by default,
unless
you have changed your file associations. &nbsp;The temporary files
used
for
printing are created in the printer output directory, which you can
choose on the <a href="DirectoriesTab.html">Default
Directories Tab</a>. &nbsp;Also,
if
you
have UNIX printing set up, you could directly print using "lpr %s"<br>

<b><u>Atari 825 Printer</u><br>

</b>
<blockquote><img style="width: 724px; height: 488px;" alt="" src="Printer825Tab.jpg"><br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Character
Set:</span><br>

This&nbsp;option allows you to choose which international character
set will be used with the printer. &nbsp;On the real Atari 825,
this was set by a DIP switch.<br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Form
Length:</span><br>

This option sets the form length, in inches, for pages output by the
Printer Emulation. &nbsp;The real Atari 825 does not have a concept
of form feeds or page length, but this setting is used to determine the
length of a page in the PDF output file from the Printer Emulation.
&nbsp;For more details, see the&nbsp;<a href="PrinterEmulation.html">Printer Emulation</a>
help page.<br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Auto
Linefeed:</span><br>

This option, which is set by default, will automatically add a linefeed
character to every carriage return sent from the emulated Atari to the
emulated Printer. &nbsp;This function was normally preformed by the
printer hardware interface or driver on the Atari (Atari 850 or other).
&nbsp;If you get blank lines in your output, you may need to turn
this option off.<br>

</blockquote>

<br>

<b><u>Atari 1020 Printer</u><br>

</b>
<blockquote><img style="width: 722px; height: 491px;" alt="" src="Printer1020Tab.jpg"><br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Pen
1-4 Color:</span><br>

This&nbsp;option
allows you to choose the color of each pen in the Atari 1020 printer.
&nbsp;specifying the values of Red, Green, and Blue between 0-255 for each one.<br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Print
Width:</span><br>

This original Atari1020 used 4" wide paper, and had a print width of
3.77 inches. &nbsp; You can use this original print width centered
in normal width modern paper, or you can specify double print width, in
which case all of the printer output will be scaled up by a factor of 2
(both height and width), and the printer output will fill most of the
width of modern paper.<br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Form
Length:</span><br>

This
option sets the form length, in inches, for pages output by the Printer
Emulation. &nbsp;The real Atari 825 does not have a concept of form
feeds or
page length, but this setting is used to determine the length of a page
in the PDF output file from the Printer Emulation. &nbsp;For more
details,
see the&nbsp;<a href="PrinterEmulation.html">Printer
Emulation</a>
help page.<br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Auto
Linefeed:</span><br>

This
option, which is set by default, will automatically add a linefeed
character to every carriage return sent from the emulated Atari to the
emulated Printer. &nbsp;This function was normally performed by the
printer
hardware interface or driver on the Atari (Atari 850 or other).
&nbsp;If you
get blank lines in your output, you may need to turn this option off.<br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Auto
Adjust Image to Start of Page:</span><br>

This
option automatically readjusts the paper, so that the output of the
printer starts at the top of the page. &nbsp;This is useful for the
1020, as the printer may print above the start paper location, and
would then print off the top of the page.<br>

<br>

<b><u>Epson FX-80 Printer</u><br>

</b>
<blockquote><img style="width: 722px; height: 491px;" alt="" src="PrinterEpsonTab.jpg"><br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Character
Set:</span><br>

This&nbsp;option
allows you to choose which international character set will be used
by default with the printer. &nbsp;On the real Epson, this was set
by a DIP switch.<br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>

Print Pitch:</span><br>

This&nbsp;option
allows you to choose which character pitch will be used by default with
the printer. &nbsp;On the real Epson, this was set by a DIP switch.<br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Print
Weight:</span><br>

This&nbsp;option
allows you to choose which character weight will be used by default
with
the printer. &nbsp;On the real Epson, this was set by a DIP switch.<br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Form
Length:</span><br>

This
option sets the form length, in inches, for pages output by the Printer
Emulation. &nbsp;On the Epson emulation, this sets both the
internal page length in the emulated printer, as well as determining
the length of a page
in the PDF output file from the Printer Emulation. &nbsp;For more
details,
see the&nbsp;<a href="PrinterEmulation.html">Printer
Emulation</a>
help page.<br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Auto
Linefeed:</span><br>

This
option, which is set by default, will automatically add a linefeed
character to every carriage return sent from the emulated Atari to the
emulated Printer. &nbsp;This function was normally performed by the
printer
hardware interface or driver on the Atari (Atari 850 or other).
&nbsp;If you
get blank lines in your output, you may need to turn this option off.<br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Print
Slashed Zero:</span><br>

This&nbsp;option
allows you to choose if zero characters are printed with a slash by
default with
the printer. &nbsp;On the real Epson, this was set by a DIP switch.<br>

  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Auto
Skip Perforation:</span><br>

This
option, sets the printer to automatically skip 6 lines at the end of
the page. &nbsp;This is very useful for program listings and other
non-page formated output. &nbsp;On the real Epson, this was set by
a DIP switch. &nbsp;Also, if you choose this option, you may
additionally choose to split the 6 lines between the top and bottom of
the page, giving a 3 line margin at the top, and a 3 line margin at the
bottom &nbsp;of the page. &nbsp;This additional option was not
available on the original printer.<br>

  <br>

</blockquote>
<b><u>ATASCII Printer</u><br>

</b>
<blockquote><img style="width: 724px; height: 488px;" alt="" src="PrinterAtasciiTab.png"><br>

  <br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Character
  Size:</span><br>

  This&nbsp;option allows you to choose the font size for
  the ATASCII character set.  The default is 12 point,
  which will produce around 45 characters per line.  The
  minimum is 7 point (around 80 characters per line) and
  the maximum is 24 point.<br>

    <br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Gap Between Lines:
  </span><br>

  This&nbsp;option allows you to choose the amount of space
  between each output line.  The default of zero points
  will allow some space between normal text, but Atari
  graphics characters will be directly next to each other
  on adjacent lines, allowing them to be used for graphics.
  You may also choose to have been 1 and 4 points of space
  in addtion to this.<br>

    <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Form
Length:</span><br>

This option sets the form length, in inches, for pages output by the
Printer Emulation. &nbsp;This setting is used to determine the
length of a page in the PDF output file from the Printer Emulation.
&nbsp;For more details, see the&nbsp;<a href="PrinterEmulation.html">Printer Emulation</a>
help page.<br>

  <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Font:</span><br>

This option allows the user to choose an ATASCII Mac font.
The default ATASII font included in the applicaiton is named
AtariClassic-Regular and it is the default selection.  If you
would like to use another font, it must have the Atari
characters starting at Unicode 0xE000, like the fonts found
here: <a href="https://atari8bit.net/atari-fonts/">https://atari8bit.net/atari-fonts/.</a>
<br>(AtariClassic font can be found here: <a href="http://members.bitstream.net/marksim/atarimac/fonts.html">http://members.bitstream.net/marksim/atarimac/fonts.html</a>)
