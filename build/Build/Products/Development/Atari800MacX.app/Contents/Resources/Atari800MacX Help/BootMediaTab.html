This tab is used to set the contents of the
Emulator's peripherals when it boots. &nbsp;Starting
with version 3.4 of the emulator, there are
two options here. &nbsp;One is to start with the
media that was present when the emulator was exited
the last time. &nbsp;This option is chosen
by checking the "Star Emulator With Media Present
When Emulator Last Exited" checkbox. &nbsp;When this
is checked, the other controls onthis tab are not
enabled.<br><br>
The other option is chosen by leaving the box
unchecked. &nbsp;Then, you can specify up to eight
floppy disks, one cartridge, one cassette, and one
directly executable file (in Atari binary format),
which will run when the emulator boots. &nbsp;This
feature lets you specify the favorite game cartridge,
or programming disk, and have it always be present
in the emulator at startup. &nbsp;To choose a disk,
cartridge, etc, simply press the button for the
device, and browse to the file. &nbsp;It's name
will appear in the middle text field. &nbsp;In
addition, you may enable or disable that particular
piece of media with the Enabled checkbox to the
right of each field.<br><br>
Also, starting in version 4.0 of the emualtor,
Configuration Files may be used. &nbsp;For more
information on them, see the Configuration Files
page. &nbsp;
However, two items here are very useful for using
with them. &nbsp;One is a checkbox which determines
if all of the current media is ejected when a new
configuration file is loaded. &nbsp;This is true by
default. &nbsp;The second is a button, which alllows
you to set the boot meda options to the media that is
currently loaded in the machine. &nbsp;Pressing this
button will set the file names for all floppies,
cartridges, and cassettes currently in the machine,
and set them to enabled. &nbsp;This is very useful
for creating new configuration files quickly, based
on your current setup.<br>
<br>
Starting with version 5.4, there is also an option
for Cartridge Boot Media that allows you to select
a special cartridge such as SIDE2 or the built in
BASIC cartridge for Atari 800.
<br>
<br>
Staring with version 5.5, there is also a button
to allow you to paste a string of keypresses into
the emulator when it starts.  The use of the
"Startup String" button is disucssed in the
