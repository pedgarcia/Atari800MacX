<br>Starting in Version 4.0,&nbsp;Atari800MacX allows the user to save
multiple preference setups through the addition of Configuration Files
and the management associated with them.<br><br><big><big><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What's in the Configuration Files?</span><br></big><br></big>A
configuration file (with extension .a8c) is a full copy of the
Prefences for Atari800MacX, stored in a different location than the
standard file
(Home/Library/Preferences/com.atarimac.atari800macx.plist), &nbsp;It's
file format is the same as a standard Apple preferences file (XML), and
can be edited by a program that edits preferences files, but be
careful, you need to know what you are doing if you try to edit it
outside the program.<br><br>The configuration file stores all of the
settings of the program, which means all of the things that are
settable from the Preferences screen (including window sizes and
fullscreen), as well as the window positions.<br><br><big style="text-decoration: underline;"><big>What are they good For?<br></big></big><br>Have
you ever wanted to have different joystick settings for different games
you play? &nbsp;Have a game that requires a language cartridge and a
single disk. &nbsp;Have a Atari programming environment that requires
several disks, a cartridge, and special settings. &nbsp;Have you wanted
to be able to access those things with a double click or a menu
selection? &nbsp;Now you can......<br><br><big style="text-decoration: underline;"><big>How do you save and load them?<br></big></big><br>On
the Preferences Screen there are buttons that allow you to do the Save
and Load of configurations directly from that panel. &nbsp;Changes from
Configuration files that are loaded from here are not applied until you
exit the Preferences screen.<br><br>You can also load and save the files from the control menu, or using Cmd-Shift-S for Save and Cmd-Shift-L for load.<br><br>Finally,
you can simply double click on the file, and it will start the emulator
(if it's not already running), and load all your settings.<br><br><big style="text-decoration: underline;"><big>How do I specify media to be loaded for the Configuration?</big></big><br><br>There
is a tab of the Preferences screen you may not have used much up to
this point. &nbsp;It is called Boot Media. &nbsp;The disks, cassettes,
and cartridges specified here, in versions prior to 4.0, were loaded
when the program started. &nbsp;Now, when you save a configuration file
with entries on this panel, those media files will be loaded when you
load the configuration, even if the program is already running (and a
coldboot of the Atari will be performed). &nbsp;There is also a button
that loads all of the current media that is loaded into the emulator
into the fields on the screen, so that you do not have to select them
one by one. &nbsp;Finally, there is a checkbox that determines if all
of the current media is ejected before new media is loaded as part of a
configuration. &nbsp;This checkbox is enabled by default, but you may
come up with configurations where you don't want to do that, but
instead want to add media to what a user has loaded prior to loading
the configuration. If so, simply uncheck the option.<br><br><br>
