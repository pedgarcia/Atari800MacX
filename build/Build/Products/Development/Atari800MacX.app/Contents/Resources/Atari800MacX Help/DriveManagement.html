The Drive Management window allows the user to easily see what floppy
disk images are in each drive. &nbsp;You may also select a new image by
simply clicking on the button with the drive number in it, or pressing
command and the number of the drive, i.e. command-1 for D1:.<br>



<br>



<u><b>Drive Status</b></u><br>



<br>



<blockquote>Each Disk drive can have one of four states:<br>



  
  
  
  <ul>



    <li>Off - This disk drive has the power turned off.</li>



    <li>Empty - The power is on to the drive, but it has no disk.</li>



    <li>Read Only - A disk is inserted, but has write protect switch on,
so that you may only read from the disk.</li>



    <li>R/W - A disk is inserted, and can be either read from or
written to.</li>



  
  
  
  </ul>



The Read Only and R/W status of the drive may be set after a disk is
inserted.<br>

<b><u>Eject All<br>



<br>



</u></b>
<blockquote>This button allows the user to eject all 8 disks from the
drive with one action. &nbsp;It has a keyboard shortcut of command-E.<br>

<b><u>Save Disk Set Button<br>



<br>



</u></b>
<blockquote>This button allows the user to save the names of the disk
images
that are currently in the drives to a file, to be loaded later.
&nbsp;The
file that the set is save in has an extension of ".set", and it is a
human
readable text file, containing the paths of the image files, or "Empty"
or
"Off" for a drive that has no disk. &nbsp;It has a keyboard shortcut of command-S.


</blockquote>



<b><u>Load Disk Set Button<br>



<br>



</u></b>
<blockquote>This button allows the user to load a disk set saved
earlier
with the Save Disk Set Button. &nbsp;The user is allowed to browse for
the
set file, displaying files ending in ".set". &nbsp;The emulator then
loads
the disk images specified in the file into the corresponding drives.
&nbsp;If
a drive in the set file is "Empty" or "Off", no changes are made to the
drive.
&nbsp; This allows the user to load multiple disk sets sequentially. &nbsp;It has a keyboard shortcut of command-L.


</blockquote>



<b><u>Rotate Floppies Button<br>



</u></b>
<blockquote>This button rotates the current inserted floppies among the
drives.&nbsp; This may be useful for playing multiple disk games. &nbsp;It has a keyboard shortcut of command-R.


</blockquote>



<u><b>New Disk Image Button<br>



<br>



</b></u>
<blockquote>This button will display a new window which you may use to
create a new disk image. &nbsp;This new image will be saved in .atr
format. It has a keyboard shortcut of command-N.<br>



  <br>



In the Create Disk Image window,&nbsp; you may choose a format of a
disk. Note that not all formats are supported by all Atari DOSes. There
are three standard formats:<br>



  
  
  
  <ul>



    <li>Single density (40 tracks * 18 sectors/track * 128 bytes/sector
= 90 KB)</li>



    <li>Medium density (40 tracks * 26 sectors/track * 128 bytes/sector
= 130 KB)</li>



    <li>Double density (40 tracks * 18 sectors/track * 256 bytes/sector
= 180 KB)</li>



  
  
  
  </ul>



You can also select any other format, by clicking Custom and setting
Number of sectors and Bytes per sector. Please make sure your Atari DOS
supports this format, otherwise the image will be unusable.<br>



  <br>



If 256 bytes per sector are selected, you can choose between 128 and
256 Bytes in boot sectors. Physically, boot sectors (first three
sectors on
a disk) are also 256 bytes long, but only 128 are transmitted between
the
Atari and a disk drive (upper halves of sectors are not used). There
are
disk images with 128 bytes in boot sectors and disk images with 256
bytes
in boot sectors. The Atari800 emulator supports both, but other
emulators
don't. Except some special cases, we recommend 128 for ATR images.<br>



  <br>



If the "Insert New Disk image into drive" checkbox is checked, the
created image will be mounted on the specified drive.<br>



  <br>

<b><u>Swap&nbsp;Disks Checkboxes<br>



</u></b>
<blockquote>These checkboxes allow you to swap&nbsp;disks in the two
drives which are
checked. &nbsp;Only
two drives may be checked at the same time, and as soon as the second
box is checked, the swap occurs. &nbsp;These boxes have keyboard
shortcuts of the number key of the drive, i.e. 1 for D1:.<br>
  <br>
