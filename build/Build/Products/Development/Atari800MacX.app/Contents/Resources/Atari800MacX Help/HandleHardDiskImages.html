Although the emulator has the ability to create
VHD hard disk images, there are some tips needed
to use them with the Mac OS.
<br><br>
For the Mac to be able to mount the disk images
to access FAT16 or FAT32 partitions, the file must
be names .img (instead of .vhd).
<br><br>
Even then the Mac is not able to mount the image if
the FAT partitions are not formated.  So the image
needs to be mounted with a special command and
formated first.  For this example, we will consider
a hard disk image, named test.img, that has a
FAT16 partition as the first partition.<br><br>
Entering the following into the Mac terminal<br><br>
<code>
sudo hdik test.img<br>
sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 /dev/disk3s1<br>
sudo hide -e /dev/disk3<br>
</code><br>
Note, the disk number may vary in your case.
In this case it is "3", so you use disk3 and disk3s1
in the commands.  The output of the hdik command will
let you determine the disk number.<br><br>
Once you have done this, from then on you can mount
the disk normally with:<br><br>
<code>
hdiutil attach test.img
</code>
